    title 'Retrieve and Validate Service Base URL List'
    description %(    
    Verify that the developer makes its Service Base URL publication publicly available
    in the Bundle resource format with valid Endpoint and Organization entries.
    This test group will issue a HTTP GET request against the supplied URL to
    retrieve the developer's Service Base URL list and ensure the list is
    publicly accessible. It will then ensure that the returned service base URL
    publication is in the Bundle resource format containing its service base URLs and
    related organizational details in valid Endpoint and Organization resources
    that follow the specifications detailed in the HTI-1 rule and the API
    Condition and Maintenance of Certification.

    For systems that provide the service base URL Bundle at a URL, please run
    all tests within this group.  While it is the expectation of the
    specification for the service base URL Bundle to be served at a
    public-facing endpoint, testers can validate a Service Base URL Bundle not
    served at a public endpoint by running Test 1.2: Validate Service Base URL
    List validation individually.
